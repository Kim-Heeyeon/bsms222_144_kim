# 2.7 Coercion
<br>
In general, *coercion* is an attempt by R to be flexible with data types. When an entry does not match the expected, some of the prebuilt R functions try to guess what was meant before throwing an error. This can also lead to confusion. Failing to understand *coercion* can drive programmers crazy when attempting to code in R since it behaves quite differently from most other languages in this regard. Letâ€™s learn about it with some examples.

We said that vectors must be all of the same type. So if we try to combine, say, numbers and characters, you might expect an error:

```{r}
x <- c(1, "canada", 3)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
